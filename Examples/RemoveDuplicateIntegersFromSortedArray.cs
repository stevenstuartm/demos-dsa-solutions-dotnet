//Given an integer array nums sorted in non-decreasing order, remove the duplicates in-place such that each unique element appears only once.The relative order of the elements should be kept the same.Then return the number of unique elements in nums.
//Consider the number of unique elements of nums to be k, to get accepted, you need to do the following things:
//Change the array nums such that the first k elements of nums contain the unique elements in the order they were present in nums initially.The remaining elements of nums are not important as well as the size of nums.
//Return k.
